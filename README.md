# hello-world
Got to start somehow, somewhere...

Don't quite know how or where to start though... Been told, 'Should do that, go there, try that...',
but not much more nowadays. Need experience, but did actually blew all the chances to do so. How
to get that now? Do need to work harder, should have known such. However probably not a matter of 
how hard to work, but how right(?) to work, apparently. There are also those other 'branches', 
namely those being them language learning and them syntax and them grammar. 

Now can see why still in need of harder work. Lesser talking. Mor... ok we're done. Hello World!
